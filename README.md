âœ¨ Iâ€™m Chyavan! Welcome to my Github profile. Feel free to check out my projects!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m a Master of Science graduate from the University of Texas, Austin

ðŸš€ To know more about me, you can visit my [Portfolio website](https://chyavan-mc.github.io/) (I'm still experimenting with the page)

âš¡ I also experiment with visualizations created in Javascript in my pastime. [Take a look](https://chyavan-mc.github.io/Creative-Coding/)!
